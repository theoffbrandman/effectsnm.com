            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>To inspire a passion in science in underserved schools in the Albuquerque area through inquiry-based learning and an early introduction to the scientific method.</p>

            <h1>Creation</h1>
            <p>In 5th grade, EFFECTS founder Quinn Ennis attended an elementary school that, because of a lack of funds, was forced to cut its STEM program.This is the unfortunate reality for many schools in our city. After a retired Los Alamos National Labs representative came to his school to teach physics on Tuesday afternoons, Quinn realized the importance of introducing science at an early age. In elementary school, Quinn appreciated the excitement of each experiment. Looking back, Quinn admires Dr. Tuitt’s ability to bridge the divide between scientific concepts, principles, and tools and the understanding of the public. As a first step towards combating this gap himself, in spring 2021, he established the EFFECTS program to provide inquiry-based STEM courses to fourth and fifth-graders at underserved elementary schools in Albuquerque.</p>
            <p>After launching the program at Alameda Elementary during summer 2021, Quinn recruited Mimi Xue and Neil Mahto to the program in November 2021, shortly after which they began working with Hawthorne Elementary.</p>
            <p>EFFECTS hopes to expand to many more underserved schools and communities in the future.</p>
            <p>“I hope to bring the same excitement to every lesson that Dr. Tuitt brought, inspiring future generations of scientists.”</p>
